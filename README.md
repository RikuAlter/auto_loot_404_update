# Update for AutoLoot Advanced Settings (Next Gen) by jerry18

Special thanks to the original authors of the mod.

After the latest 4.04 update of The Witcher 3, the above mod seems to be causing conflicts while compiling game scripts so, I updated this mod file to resolve the issues.

For 4.04 update CDPR have added radial menu options and modified playerWitcher.ws

So, I have taken their modified playerWitcher script and added the necessary lines to make this mod work.

I have also gone though the other files that this mod modified from the base game and I haven't found and updates that CDPR have made on these files as of update 4.04
